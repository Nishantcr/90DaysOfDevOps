What is devops?
DevOps is all about the unification and automation of processes, and DevOps engineers are instrumental in combining code, application maintenance, and application management. 
All of these tasks rely on understanding not only development life cycles, but DevOps culture, and its practices, and tools.
/#
Why DevOps is Important ?
Before devops, the development and operation team worked in complete isolation.
Testing and deployment were isolated activities done after design-build, hence they consumed more time
than  actual build cycles.
Instead of building the project team members spend enarmous amount of time in testing, deploying, desigining
the project.
Spent more time of human errors due to manual code deployment.
Operation and coding teams are not available at the same time causing further delays.
/#
What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure
Automating the code deployment process with out any intruption for example CI/CD pipeline.
Scalability :- It is possible to scale the application easily when you are expecting a traffic and it is also easier to downgrade if you are have a lot of resources which are not getting used currently.
Availability :- By using devops tools and technologies, your product will be highly available for end customers to user.
